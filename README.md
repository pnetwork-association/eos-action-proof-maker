# :herb: pToken EOS Action-Proof Maker

&nbsp;

A tool for making __`merkle-proofs`__ for proving action retirement in an __`EOS`__ block!

***

&nbsp;

### :biohazard: Important Caveat:

One key Dan Larrimer quote:

> Given an action, somewhere in the [EOS] blockchain, it is possible to succinctly prove the retirement of that action by first proving that it was committed to by a block’s Action Root, and then that the given block was committed to by a trusted irreversible block header’s Block Root.

...found in __[this article here](https://steemit.com/eos/@dan/inter-blockchain-communication-via-merkle-proofs-with-eos-io)__ and which article I've attempted to archive via the __[WayBackMachine](https://web.archive.org/web/20191112104752/https://steemit.com/eos/@dan/inter-blockchain-communication-via-merkle-proofs-with-eos-io)__ to no avail due presumably to something on Steemit's end...and so but however back on point the quote above is verbatim and points out the thorny issue that no EOS __`action`__ can be proven to have been __irreversibly__ retired _without_ trust. Tying the __`action`__'s retirement to an _irreversible_ block requires that that _irreversible_ block is a trusted one.

### :point_right: Usage:

```

❍ EOS Action-Proof Maker ❍

    Copyright Greg Kapka 2019
    Questions: greg@oraclize.it

❍ Info ❍

A tool to make merkle-proofs over EOS actions in order to prove that action's
retirement in a given block.

❍ Usage ❍

Usage:
        eos_action_proof_maker [--help]
        eos_action_proof_maker generate (<JSON> | --file=<PATH>)

Options:

    --help              ❍ Show this message.

    generate            ❍ Command to generate a merkle-proof for the action in
                          the supplied JSON tying it to the `action_mroot` in
                          the EOS block in that same JSON. Returns an array of
                          hex-string digests forming the branch of the
                          merkle-tree.

    --file=<path>       ❍ Path to a file containg a JSON of an EOS block and all
                          its `action_receipts` & the action you desire a proof
                          for.

    <JSON>              ❍ A valid JSON string of an object containing keys:
                          `block`           ➔ The EOS block header.
                          `action`          ➔ The action you want a proof for.
                          `action_receipts` ➔ An array of all the action
                                              receipts pertaining to the block
                                              in question.

    <PATH>              ❍ Path to a file containing the valid <JSON> string
                          described above.

### :microscope: Example

If you go and look in the __`/example`__ directory you'll find some sample __EOS__ block __JSONs__ & shell scripts you can run to see how the tool works. Run the example via: __`❍ ./example-1.sh`__.

Output of example:

### :wrench: Build

To build this yourself, make sure you have __`Rust`__ installed then clone the dir:

__`❍ git clone https://github.com/gskapka/eos-action-proof-maker.git`__

Enter the dir:

__`❍ cd eos-action-proof-maker`__

And finally build via:

__`❍ cargo build --release`__

You'll find your binary in the __`./target/release/`__ directory.

&nbsp;

### :black_nib: Notes

 - This tool does __DOES NOT__ (yet) validate the block header of the passed in block.

 - The tool __DOES__ validate that the supplied __`actions`__ all merkle together to create the __`action_mroot`__ in the block supplied. If this validation step does not pass, the proof will not be generated and instead the tool will exit with code __`1`__ and print to __`stderr`__:

```

✘ Error validating action receipts!
✘ Action receipt merkle root does NOT match `action_mroot`!

```

 - If you supply and action whose digest is not found amongst the supplied __`action_receipts`__, the tool will exit with code __`1`__ & print to __`stderr`__:

```

✘ Could not find action digest in action receipts!

```

 - A recent EOS fork enabled actions to return values, and this tool now defaults to the action digest calculation for these new action types, but _only_ for those action which return _no_ value. For previous behaviour on chains where this EOS protocol feature is not active, build the tool with via:

```

cargo b -r --features=disable-action-return-value-protocol-feature

```

***

&nbsp;

### :guardsman: Tests

To run the tests simply enter the dir and run:

__`❍ cargo test`__

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

### :black_nib: To Do:

- [x] Verify proof as last step before emitting proof.
- [x] Add more tests!
- [ ] Validate the block header too?
- [x] Validate the individual actions too?
- [x] Validate the action at the supplied index w/r/t to it's hex data
